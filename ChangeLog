17.2 31.9.2016
==============
- do not remove RTP streams when converting to audio which cannot be duplicates based on its timeframe (when phone puts on hold and SSRC does not change for example)
- add amr-wb support (fixes MOS score for amr-wb)
- fix cachedir option [VS-486] 
- add sniffer version to end of syslog lines
- fix filtering in register active by sniffer id [VG-999]
- fix UA store in register_state and register_failed 


17.1 24.9.2016
==============
- fix MOS scoring for all codecs which was gradually increasing to 4.5. Longer calls have always better MOS score. MOS intervals were always higher with time increase. 
- fix MOS score for AMR which was always 4.5 
- fix memory leak in case sip-register was enabled(>= 17.0) (add cleanupregisters manager command for testing purpose) 
- add mark line in .graph for AMR VAD frames
- new option rtpthreads_start (only for testing purpose) 
- fix crash when voipmonitor is stopped during spool cleaning [VS-481]
- new option rtpfromsdp_onlysip (default no) which if enabled it takes RTP for audio decode only with the same IP addresses as SIP packets (in other words it will ignore all RTP streams with another IPs than SIP packets) [VS-469]
- fix pcap_queue_use_blocks option which if enable threading mod >= 2 must be enabled [VS-480]
- fix sql query for alter table files (remove db name)
- fix memory limit when buffer reaches limit (it could be still possible to eat all memory if sniffer cannot keep up with traffic) 
- add new option snaplen [VS-477]
- fix crash in query_cache mode at start if cache file / line not contain separator ':'
- fix conditions for hide message option in capture rule
- signifficantly speedup sniffer mirroring
- new options mirror_require_confirmation and mirror_use_checksum


17.0.1 8.10.2016
===============
- refactor call live listenting [VG-977]
- fix filtercommand disable in capture rules and do not run it on REGISTER (only INVITE and MESSAGE) [VG-983]
- fix capture rules sniffer reload which was applied only from second call [VG-982]


17.0 1.10.2016
=============
- redesign SIP REGISTER alerts - it now uses memory storage instead of sending every SIP registration to the database [VG-43] [VS-467]
- make mirroring packets more robust - added crc and block count confirmations (do not loose data in case sniffers gets disconnected or other faulty state)
- new in-memory SIP REGISTER alert rules
- new secondary spool which can be enabled per single capture rules (in GUI -> capture rules -> secondary storage) - this allows to store recordings for longer period than default [VG-57]
- added new command line options: --reindex-all, --run-cleanspool
- when converting to audio do not remove streams which looks like duplicate but it is not
- fix pcapscandir option in case some call are divided to more files [VS-473]


16.1.2 8.9.2016
===============
- fix potential crash in pcap_queue_use_blocks mode (rare configuration option) 
- fix mirror if set pcap_queue_use_blocks mode
- fix saving rtpc if save rtp is disabled [VG-944]


16.1.1 28.8.2016
================
- Merge SDP rtpmap instead of keeping rtpmap from last SDP - for example if re-INVITE does not have dynamic payload in SDP but the RTP stream continues on dynamic payload from previous INVITE the voipmonitor will now handle it properly
